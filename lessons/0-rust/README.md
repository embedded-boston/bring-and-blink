## Goals

1. Show off how easy it can be to use rust:
  - how to set up
  - how to compile, debug, and program
  - how to do basic basic hardware interaction
2. Build a community of people doing rust development on embedded.
3. Leave with a fun little example
4. Leave with an awesome STM32F3 development board.
5. Leave with a quick rust embedded elevator pitch.
6. Discuss caveats and where major improvements can be found.
